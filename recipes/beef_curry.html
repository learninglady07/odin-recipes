        <p><h2>Ingredients: </h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>5 green chile peppers, finely sliced </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>3 whole cardamom seeds</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1Â½ (2 inch) cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h3>Steps: </h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; 
                cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until 
                the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, 
                and cinnamon sticks. Cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, 
                3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, 
                and water into the onion mixture. Simmer until most of the water has 
                evaporated and the mixture has thickened.</li>
            <li>Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; 
                simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beef 
                is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p><strong>Editor's Note: </strong></p>
        <p>Use 5 to 6 small green chile peppers, such as Thai chiles; 
            if they're unavailable, substitute 2 to 3 serrano chiles or to taste. 
            Use rubber gloves when chopping chile peppers.</p>
